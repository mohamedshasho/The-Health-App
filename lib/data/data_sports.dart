  '''1-Strength training through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.

2-Specialized nutrition, incorporating extra protein and supplements when necessary.

3-Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.''',

5.When running in cold weather wear hat, gloves and clothing that covers your neck.''',
  '''Rest
Although muscle stimulation occurs in the gym (or home gym) when lifting weights, muscle growth occurs afterward during rest periods.

Without adequate rest and sleep (6 to 8 hours), muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and grow.

 Additionally, many athletes find that a daytime nap further increases their body's ability to recover from training and build muscles. 
 
 Some bodybuilders add a massage at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering.
 
 Overtraining
Main article:

Overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where their workload exceeds their recovery capacity.

There are many reasons why overtraining occurs, 
including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts,
 insufficient sleep, 
 and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts).''',
